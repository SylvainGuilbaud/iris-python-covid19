##IRIS Native API + Python + COVID-19 Data
A project solution using Python as application language and the IRIS as a database to observe and learn how to use IRIS Native API. 

## Why COVID-19 Data?
As the pandemy evolves in the world a lot of information are being spreaded so I decide to create an application to audit those information.
Unfornatelly each country has a different test policy so I decided to use the death data to avoid the cases subnotifications.

## How to run local?
After clone this repo, open a terminal and go to the iris-python-covid19 and type this command:

```
docker-compose up
```

After a while you can open your browser and go to the address, you will see some warnings of error because maybe the python container will start first and will restart until the IRIS container be prepared.

```
http://localhost:8050
```

##I don't want to run local
It's your luck day! You can see the screenshots here =) 

##Thanks
Collaboration are welcome! I'll perform some changes here in the code but I think it's a good start to the ones who use python!
